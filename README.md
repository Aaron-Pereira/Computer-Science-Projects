# Aaron Pereira - Project Portfolio

Hi, I'm Aaron! ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Computing Science (Honours) from UTS, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My passion lies in data analytics, machine learning, and software development, and I am eager to apply my technical skills in real-world applications.

This repository is a space to showcase my projects, track my learning, and connect with like-minded individuals in tech.

## Data Analysis Projects

This section showcases data analytics projects I have undertaken, demonstrating my ability to extract insights from data, build visualizations, and apply machine learning techniques. Each project includes a brief outline of the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and any notable technical implementations.

These projects reflect my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and other data analysis tools, as well as my ability to work with real-world datasets to drive meaningful conclusions. Whether it's exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, or data storytelling, this portfolio highlights my passion for turning raw data into actionable insights.
