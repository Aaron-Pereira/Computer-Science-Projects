## Data Analysis Projects

This section showcases data analytics projects I have undertaken, demonstrating my ability to extract insights from data, build visualizations, and apply machine learning techniques. Each project includes a brief outline of the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and any notable technical implementations.

These projects reflect my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and other data analysis tools, as well as my ability to work with real-world datasets to drive meaningful conclusions. Whether it's exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, or data storytelling, this portfolio highlights my passion for turning raw data into actionable insights.

Goal: Analyze historical data from Tennis Grand Slam Championships to uncover patterns in player performance, nationality dominance, and match outcomes using data visualization techniques.

Description: This project explores Grand Slam championship data, focusing on trends in player victories, win rates, and nationality-based performance analysis. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical calculations to identify key insights, such as the most dominant players, match-winning trends, and country-level performance. The project utilizes Tableau to create interactive visualizations, including treemaps, parallel coordinate plots, and geographic maps, to present findings effectively.

Skills: Data Cleaning & Processing, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis

Technology: Tableau


### Analysing Australian Exports and Imports

Goal: Analyze Australia's export and import trends from 1988 to 2021 to identify key patterns, economic shifts, and trade dependencies across various industries.

Description: This project examines Australia's trade data, focusing on long-term trends in imports and exports across multiple industries. It includes data preparation, trend analysis, and visualization to highlight significant economic shifts, such as the rise of crude material exports, the decline in tobacco trade, and fluctuations in machinery and transport equipment. Using Tableau dashboards and storyboards, the project presents key insights through time series, stacked bar charts, area graphs, and treemaps, making trade trends easily interpretable.

Skills: Data Cleaning & Transformation, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization
