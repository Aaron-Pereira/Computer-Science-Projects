**Goal:** Analyze historical data from Tennis Grand Slam Championships to uncover patterns in player performance, nationality dominance, and match outcomes using data visualization techniques.

**Description:** This project explores Grand Slam championship data, focusing on trends in player victories, win rates, and nationality-based performance analysis. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical calculations to identify key insights, such as the most dominant players, match-winning trends, and country-level performance. The project utilizes Tableau to create interactive visualizations, including treemaps, parallel coordinate plots, and geographic maps, to present findings effectively.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning & Processing, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis.

**Technology:** Tableau.


### Analysing Australian Exports and Imports

**Goal:** Analyze Australia's export and import trends from 1988 to 2021 to identify key patterns, economic shifts, and trade dependencies across various industries.

**Description:** This project examines Australia's trade data, focusing on long-term trends in imports and exports across multiple industries. It includes data preparation, trend analysis, and visualization to highlight significant economic shifts, such as the rise of crude material exports, the decline in tobacco trade, and fluctuations in machinery and transport equipment. Using Tableau dashboards and storyboards, the project presents key insights through time series, stacked bar charts, area graphs, and treemaps, making trade trends easily interpretable.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning & Transformation, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization.

**Technology:** Tableau.


## Machine Learning Projects

This section showcases machine learning projects I have undertaken, demonstrating my ability to build, train, and evaluate models for a variety of real-world applications. Each project includes a brief outline of the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and notable technical implementations.

These projects highlight my skills in Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and deep learning frameworks, as well as my ability to work with diverse datasets to develop predictive models, classification systems, and anomaly detection solutions. Whether it's natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, or traditional machine learning, this portfolio reflects my passion for leveraging AI to solve complex problems and drive meaningful insights.


### Heart Disease Classification

[Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/Aaron-Pereira/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/960387af930679d6efda83ba4b15815a808b020f/Heart%20Disease%20Classification/Heart_Disease_Classification.ipynb)

**Goal:** Develop a machine learning model to classify patients based on heart disease risk using medical dataset features.

**Description:** This project implements Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a structured dataset. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training. The model is trained using gradient descent optimization, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess model generalization, and visualizations are used to analyze key health indicators.

**Skills:** Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Logistic Regression.

**Technology:** Python.
